# Customer-Segmentation-System
This project aims to develop a customer segmentation system using three different clustering algorithms: DBSCAN, K-Means, and Model-Based Clustering. The system is designed to help businesses identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behaviors, demographics, or any other relevant features.
