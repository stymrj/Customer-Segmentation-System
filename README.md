# Customer Segmentation System
This project aims to develop a customer segmentation system using three different clustering algorithms: DBSCAN, K-Means, and Model-Based Clustering. The system is designed to help businesses identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behaviors, demographics, or any other relevant features. The project utilizes a dataset obtained from Kaggle and provides visualizations of the clustering results for each algorithm.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle and is available as a CSV file named customer_segmentation.csv. You can download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the data directory within the project.
# Methodology
The customer segmentation system is developed using the following methodology:

- Data Collection:
Obtain a relevant dataset from a reliable source. In this project, we used the "Customer Segmentation" dataset from Kaggle.

- Data Preprocessing: Perform necessary preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data for clustering. This may include handling missing values, removing duplicates, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Conduct exploratory analysis to gain insights into the dataset and understand the distributions, relationships, and patterns within the data. Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices are created to assist in this analysis.

- Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features for customer segmentation. This step may involve using domain knowledge, statistical techniques, or feature importance methods to select the features that have the most significant impact on customer behavior.

- Clustering Algorithms: Apply three different clustering algorithms to segment the customers based on their characteristics. The algorithms used in this project are:

- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): This algorithm groups together data points that are closely packed, marking outliers as noise. It does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance.

- K-Means: This centroid-based algorithm aims to partition the data into K clusters, where K is pre-defined. It assigns each data point to the nearest centroid, iteratively optimizing the cluster centers to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares.

- Model-Based Clustering: This algorithm assumes that the data is generated from a mixture of probability distributions. It estimates the parameters of these distributions to identify clusters. In this project, we used the Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering algorithm.

- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each clustering algorithm. Common evaluation metrics for clustering include silhouette score, inertia, or visual inspection of the resulting clusters. Compare and analyze the results of each algorithm to determine their effectiveness in customer segmentation.

- Visualization: Generate visualizations of the clustering results for each algorithm. These visualizations provide a graphical representation of the identified customer segments, enabling a better understanding of the clustering outcomes.

- Interpretation and Insights: Interpret the clustering results and derive meaningful insights about the customer segments. Analyze the characteristics and behaviors of each segment to gain actionable knowledge that can drive targeted marketing strategies or business decisions.
